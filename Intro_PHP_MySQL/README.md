## Course description

PHP is the language that powers Facebook, Wikipedia, WordPress, and more--in fact, it is the most common server-side language on the web! You can use PHP to build interactive, dynamic websites. We will go over the basics of programming with PHP--variables, functions, loops, and more! We will also show you how to connect your code to a MySQL database. By the end of the class you will have a fully functional PHP website.

### Tech requirements:

 - Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
